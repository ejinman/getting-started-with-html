  <b> The World Wide Web</b>
<p> The web is made up of tons of computers that communicate with each other via <b>HTTP</b>(Hyper Text Transfer protocol). <br>
The Major pieces of the web are you and your internet connected computer > The internet itself > servers serving .html pages.
<p><b>HTML</b></P>
HTML stands for <b>Hyper Text Markup Language</b>
<br>HTML is made up of text and is the main type of of document found on the web.
<br>HTML documents are made of HTML elements, HTML tags tell browsers the type of elements. <br> I would include examples of tags and elements in here ,but I am not sure how to do it without it coming across as content. :)</p>
